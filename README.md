# 30daygroupproject

Cool group project!

## Requirements
- Flask
- Python 3

## Flask Backend

This app uses a Python Flask app as a backend. [This guide](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-your-first-web-application-using-flask-and-python-3) was used to initialize.

### Running Backend

To run the backend flask app first `cd` into the `backend` directory:
```bash
cd backend
```
Next, export the following variables
```bash
export FLASK_APP=app
export FLASK_ENV=development
```
Then run the flask app:
```bash
flask run
```
The flask app will now be visible at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`
